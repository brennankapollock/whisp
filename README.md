## About The Project

![](assets/screenshots/dashboard.png)


I created this app to teach myself React Native and Redux. It allows users to "sign in" by entering their name, select a current location and desired destination, select the ideal ride type based on distance and pricing, and then "confirm" the ride to be orderd.


## Built With

React Native | Expo | Tailwind | Redux | Material UI


### Viewing

You can find a live demo of the app using expo via [this link](https://expo.dev/@brennankapollock/whisp). Simply scan the QR code with your phones camera and follow the instructions. If you'd like to see a walkthrough without having to download expo you can see that below.
